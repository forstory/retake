with any other person on this exam, nor use anyone else's code in your solution.

## Tasks

    - Code / Copy URL
    - File / New / Project from Version Control...
    - Git / GitHub / Share Project on GitHub (not change the name of the repository)
1. (2 points) Create a ***Matrix*** class. In ***Matrix*** create the ***minimum*** and the
